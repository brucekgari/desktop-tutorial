    "### What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are extremely intuitive ways to classify objects or predict continuous values: you simply ask a series of questions designed to zero-in on the classification/prediction. For example, if you wanted to build a decision tree to classify an animal you come across while on a hike, you might construct the one shown here:\n",

    "<img src=\"https://cocalc.com/share/raw/8b892baf91f98d0cf6172b872c8ad6694d0f7204/PythonDataScienceHandbook/notebooks/figures/05.08-decision-tree.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary splitting makes this extremely efficient: in a well-constructed tree, each question will cut the number of options by approximately half, very quickly narrowing the options even among a large number of classes.\n",
    "The trick, of course, comes in deciding which questions to ask at each step.\n",
    "In machine learning implementations of decision trees, the questions generally take the form of axis-aligned splits in the data, that is, each node in the tree splits the data into two groups using a cutoff value within one of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions made by the tree are the _modes_ of the class labels in each specific group of observations (i.e.: the training data). This is different to regression, where the predictions were the _means_ of the response values in each group.\n",
