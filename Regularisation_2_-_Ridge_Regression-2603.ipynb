    "## Regularisation in 5 minutes\n",
    "Before we get started with the code in this train, let's go through the theory behind regularisation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When performing variable selection as we may have in previous trains, manual variable selection is often performed to improve the predictive accuracy of a model. The process of variable selection is discrete in that we either keep a variable, or we throw it away.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation offers an alternative method in which all predictor variables are included, but are subject to constraint. Recall that the least squares method seeks to minimise the sum of the squares of the residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "which can be written in terms of the predictor variable coefficients, [$b_1, b_2, b_p$], and slope, $a$:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(a+\\sum_{j=1}^pb_jx_{ij}))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where _n_ is the number of observations, and _p_ is the number of predictor variables. In the case of **ridge regression**, the regression coefficients are calculated as the values that minimise:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-(a+\\sum_{j=1}^pb_jx_{ij}))^2 + \\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is rewritten simply as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{\\beta} (RSS + \\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In minimising _RSS_ , we improve the overall fit of the model. In the newly introduced term, $\\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^pb_j^2$, the intention is to penalise those individual coefficients that get too large (those that contribute the most to reducing the fit).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new term, $\\alpha$ is a tuning parameter (which we calculate later on), which controls the degree to which the regression coefficients are penalised. The effect of this penalty parameter is to create a tradeoff between how much a coefficient contributes to minimising RSS and the size of the coefficient. In other words: _training fit_ vs. _size of coefficients_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the newly introduced term, we can see that the penalty parameter is applied to the sum of the squares of the coefficients. This means that as we increase the size of the coefficients, the penalty will increase too. And so, this has the effect of _shrinking_ the coefficients towards zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data scaling is essential in regularisation as regularising penalizes a model for large coefficients. The magnitude of coefficients is dependent on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The strength of the relationship between the predictor variables (`x`) and the output variable (`y`)\n",
    "* The units of measurement of x(eg. distance measured in millimetres or metres).For example, if x is measured in metres, and its coefficient is 5; if it is expressed in kilometres, its coefficient will be 5*10³.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want regularisation to be impacted by the strength of the relationship that exists between `x` and `y` variables and not the latter case. Thus, to eliminate the impact of the units of measurement of the variables on the coefficients, data scaling is performed to ensure variables are fairly scaled. **Z-score standardisation** is a great way to scale variables such that they have similar (though not identical) ranges, in a way that is fairly robust to outlier values. Let's go ahead an apply standard scaling to our model. \n",
