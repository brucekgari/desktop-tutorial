    "We exist in a technological era where there is far too much content (movies, news articles, shopping products, websites, etc.) for individual items to each receive our personal consideration. For example, consider that the average Google search returns well over 1 million results, yet when last did you look at the websites past the [first page](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats)?  This fact is often illustrated by what is known as the \"long tail problem\" (represented in the figure above), where tracking user engagement with items in a large content repository sees a small number of these items receiving a disproportionate amount of attention, while the majority of items are unexplored. The truth is that a user simply doesn't know of each item which exists, nor has the time to inspect each item even if it were known. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the above challenge, a natural question for service providers becomes: \"how do I ensure that an individual is shown a manageable portion of the total content I have available, while also ensuring that this content is relevant to and desired by them?\" It turns out that this is actually an extremely valuable question, both economically and within society as a whole. Luckily for us, decades of hard work by very intelligent individuals has largely answered this question through a collection of algorithms and computing techniques known as recommender systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a recommender system functions by predicting a user's rating or preference for an item. This allows a service provider to build up a catalog of items which it believes the user will want to examine - thereby increasing their engagement with the service and allowing a wider array of content to be considered.\n",

We will also learn how to create a simple implementation of one of the two dominant methods currently studied in relation to recommender systems, referred to as content-based filtering. \n",

    "### Terminology: Users, Items, and Ratings  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do when speaking about recommender systems is to get some terminology straight. Within a recommender system, there are two primary sets of entities: the Users and the Items. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we'd expect, **an item is a thing which is consumed**. It can be watched, read, bought, clicked-on, or considered. Items are passive; meaning that their properties or nature does not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Users are individuals who interact with the items in a recommendation system**. Through their *actions*, **users create ratings for specific items within a recommendation system**. Ratings can be either *explicit* (such as giving your favorite movie 5/5 stars on review) or *implicit* (such as watching a movie; even though you haven't rated it directly, by viewing something you indicate that you have some interest in it). Within this train, we only consider explicit ratings, but many of the principles covered here will apply to implicit ratings as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A given user can have ratings for many items in the system, or none at all. Generally, as a user continues to interact with a recommender system, the more it will be able to capture her preferences and ratings for items. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learnt about the entities which exist within recommender systems, we may wonder how they function. While this is something that we'll learn throughout this entire train, one fundamental principal that we need to understand is that recommender systems are built up by utilising the _relations_ which  exist between items and users. As such, these systems always need a mechanism to measure how related or _similar_ a user is to another user, or an item is to another item. \n",
    "\n",
    "We accomplish this measurement of similarity through, you guessed it, a _similarity metric_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a similarity metric can be thought of as being the inverse of a distance measure: if two things are considered to be very similar they should be assigned a high similarity value (close to 1), while dissimilar items should receive a low similarity value (close to zero). Other [important properties](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.2/1b.2.1) include:\n",
    " - (Symmetry) $Sim(A,B) = Sim(B,A)$ \n",
    " - (Identity) $Sim(A,A) = 1$\n",
    " - (Uniqueness) $Sim(A,B) = 1 \\leftrightarrow A = B$\n",
    " \n",
    "While there are many similarity metrics to choose from when building a recommender system (and more than one can certainly be used simultaneously), a popular choice is the **Cosine similarity**. We won't go into the fundamental trig here (we hope that you remember this from high school), but recall that as an angle becomes smaller (approaching $0^o$) the value of its cosine increases. Conversely, as the angle increases the cosine value decreases. It turns out that this behavior makes the cosine of the angle between two p-dimensional vectors desirable as a [similarity metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) which can easily be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the figure above to help guide our understanding, the Cosine similarity between two p-dimensional vectors ${A}$ and $B$ can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  &= \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\times ||B||} \\\\ \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align} $$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things a little more concrete, let's work out the cosine similarity using our provided example above. Here, each vector represents the ratings given by one of two *users*, $A$ and $B$, who have each rated two books (rating#1 $ \\rightarrow r_1$, and rating#2 $ \\rightarrow r_2$). To work out how similar these two users are based on their supplied ratings, we can use the Cosine similarity definition as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  & = \\frac{(A_{r1} \\times B_{r1})+(A_{r2} \\times B_{r2})}{\\sqrt{A_{r1}^2 + A_{r2}^2} \\times \\sqrt{B_{r1}^2 + B_{r2}^2}} \\\\ \\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{(3 \\times 5) + (4 \\times 2)}{\\sqrt{9 + 16} \\times \\sqrt{25 + 4}} \\\\ \\\\\n",

    "& = 0.854\n",
    "\\end{align} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a pain to work this out manually each time! Thankfully, we can obtain this same result using the `cosine_similarity` function provided to us in `sklearn`. \n",

    "## Assessing the Performance of a Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing we need to consider before we dive into the inner workings of recommender system algorithms is the aspect of how to evaluate their performance. After all, how can you tell if a recommendation is good if the item being suggested is something you've never seen before? \n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to use a statistical method such as [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), where two very similar users are shown different recommendations; with user `A` being shown randomly selected items from our catalog, and user `B` being shown recommendations generated by our algorithm. Unfortunately, like other areas of machine learning, this strategy may be a bit too risky/expensive to let a poor recommendation system (or random recommendations!) be exposed to users. Instead, in a similar approach to other machine learning fields, we tend to make use of historical rating data collected from users to test our systems. Here, as we have seen before, we partition our historical rating data into train and test splits; using train data to help build and tune our recommendation algorithms, while test data are withheld in order to perform assessment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, there are two main variants of metrics which we use to evaluate the predictions made by a recommender system: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective performance measures for a recommendation system provide results which do not depend upon personal interpretation in order to assign success. These measures tend to focus around actual preference/ratings given by users to items, and are compared against ratings/preference predicted by an algorithm. Common examples of objective measures include: \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Single-value metrics:** These are quantities which we've seen before such as RMSE and MAE which measure the error between a known and predicted rating on a continuous scale. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "   - **Catalog-based metrics:** These are measures of performance computed over lists of recommended items generated for a user. They mainly consist of variations surrounding what is known as the *hit-rate*, which determines the number of highly-rated items appearing in a recommendation list which the user has actually given a high rating to.    \n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Coverage:** This metric is calculated across multiple user recommendation lists, and returns the number of users who received at least one high-rated recommendation in their list. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Subjective Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "As a natural contrast to objective performance measures, subjective metrics provide quantitative values which must be interpreted in order to determine success. These measures typically capture characteristics of recommendations which are not directly related to rating data, but which nonetheless may be very important when a user decides whether or not to follow a suggestion. Two popular measures are:   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Novelty:** This is a measure of how many under-rated items (not to be confused with poorly-rated ones) are suggested to a user. Exposing individuals to lesser-known items in a catalog is, as we have already discussed, vital to a recommender system's functioning. \n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's use the image above to help us see how this works. Mpho is an avid reader who has just finished the novel \"The Golden Compass\". Besides the written contents inside this book (item), it has certain attributes or properties which further describe it - such as the author (\"Philip Pullman\"), genre (\"fantasy\"), or target audience (\"young adult\"). These properties are not unique to this novel, as other books also have authors, genres, target audiences, etc. As such, we can compare the properties of different books with the assumption that books which have properties in common (such as author or genre) are similar to one another. We can further **assume that individuals like similar items**. For our example, this means that Mpho, if using content-based filtering to recommend her next book, would have a book such as \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" suggested to her over Anne Frank's \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", as the former novel is far more 'similar' to The Golden Compass.     \n",

Following along from our example above, we're going to use the `tag_name` field for each book as a representation of properties such as genre, time-period, and target audience. We're also going to consider the `authors` field, as individuals often enjoy reading novels written by the same author. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by creating a new column in our `books` dataframe called `auth_tags`, which contains the above-motivated contents for each item. We additionally create two pandas series objects to help us translate between book titles and indexes of our dataframe.  "

For example,  other works by Tolkien and Shakespeare are highly recommended when using reference searches for \"The Hobbit\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" respectively. This could be a natural result of the fact that an author's name is far less common in the dataset than other textual features such as genre. As such, books which share an author will be regarded as being far more similar.  \n",

    "Based on these observations, we can ask if in fact the recommendations for \"The Hobbit\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" are actually any good? After all, a reader who knows of Tolkien and Shakespeare will often already know of other books these authors have written as well. This is where some of the subjective metrics introduced earlier (such as diversity), can be used to penalize these recommendations and help discover better ones. \n",

    "We covered alot of good ground in this train by identifying the building blocks of recommender systems; items (things) and users (people). We've learned how recommender algorithms fundamentally use similarity as a mechanism to compare these items and users, with item-item similarity being represented by the content-based filtering method. We went on to review the content-based filtering method both theoretically and  practically through code implementation. \n",
