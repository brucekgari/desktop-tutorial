    "## What are 'joins'?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Joins are used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. Say we need information from two different tables, and we want to return this information in one output from a query. We need to think about how these two tables are linked, so that we can display the information we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are combined using primary and foreign keys of the tables. Reminder:\n",
    "- A primary key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. e.g student number, id number.\n",
    "- A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a JOIN statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column(s)\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "<join_type> JOIN table2\n",
