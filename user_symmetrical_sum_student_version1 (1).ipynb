    "**Finding the Sum of a Symmetrical Sub-List**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Create a function called symmetrical_sum which takes a Python list of integers as input and searches for a 'symmetrical' inner-portion of the list. Here symmetry is said to occur if the value of the  ith  element from the start of the list is equal to the value of the  ith  value from the end of the list. The inner-portion then consists of all elements between and including these equal values. If found, the function returns both the symmetrical part of the list, as well as the sum of its constituent elements as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function arguments: lst - a Python list containing elements of type int. Note: len(lst)  â‰¥0 \n",
    "Returns: A Python tuple of the form ([symmetrical-portion], sum-of-symmetrical-portion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** symmetrical_sum([10,8,7,5,9,8,15]) == ([8, 7, 5, 9, 8], 37). Here a symmetrical portion of the list is formed by the elements at the second and second-last index, which share a value of 8. The function returns this symmetrical portion, as well as its sum of 37 within a a single tuple."
