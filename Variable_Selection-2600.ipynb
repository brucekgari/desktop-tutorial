    "**Variables** are the basic building blocks of datasets. The quality of the variables present within your dataset has a direct impact on the intuition and overall outcome of your machine learning model. Although similar machine models may be implemented within the same industry, this does not mean they necessarily require the same features. **Variable selection** and an in-depth knowledge of the domain you're building your model in remains essential when developing a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of regression is essentially to build associations between multiple variables. Variable selection involves the elimination of input variables which may in turn reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, improve the performance of the model. Within this Train we will investigate appropriate ways of performing this model selection. \n",

    "In this train we learned about variables and the some of the different variable types that can exist in the datasets we attempt to model. We also learned how to deal with categorical data types using dummy variable encoding. We were introduced to various methods of variable selection and elimination; particularly implementing the use of summary statistics, correlation, significance and variance threshold methods for variable selection.
